# 3 corner stones of Object Oriented Programming (OOP) are
#   Encapsulation, Inheritance, and Polymorphism
# data can be encapsulated within a class
# derived classes inherit the properties of their base class

# create a class file that declares a class with methods to display strings unique to the class

class Duck:
    def talk(self):
        print('\nDuck Says: Quack!')

    def coat(self):
        print('Duck Wears: Feathers')
